<h2>Welcome to the Ries Lab of Butterfly Informatics</h2>

Our main website is <a href="www.butterflyinformatics.org">here.</a>
<p>We study large-scale patterns of insects, mostly butterflies, using a combination of laboratory and data-intensive approaches. Our laboratory work on thermal tolerances is designed to provide key parameters for large-scale distribution and phenology models that we then test with independent distribution data, mostly acquired from citizen science monitoring programs. We also support and curate a variety of databases that provide information on ecological traits and distribution which are a resource for the public. Finally, we lead efforts to support a network of butterfly monitoring programs throughout North America, especially geared towards data management, curation and sharing.</p>
